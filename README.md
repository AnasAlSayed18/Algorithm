# Optimal Strategy for a Game using Dynamic Programming

## Computer Science Department - COMP336 (1st Semester 2024/2025)

### 1st Project (Dynamic Programming)

This project is an implementation of the **Optimal Strategy for a Game** using the **Dynamic Programming** technique.

## Problem Description
This is a two-player game where an even number of coins are arranged in a row. Players take turns selecting either the first or last coin in the row. The goal is to determine the **maximum possible amount of money** a player can **definitely win** if they move first, while considering the opponent's best possible strategy.

## Solution Approach
To solve this problem, we use **Dynamic Programming** to ensure that we collect the maximum amount without underestimating the opponent's choices. The strategy involves:
- Selecting either the first or last coin.
- Choosing the option that results in giving the opponent the lesser amount.
- Ensuring the maximum guaranteed winnings regardless of the opponent's moves.

## Expected Input and Output
**Example Input:**
```plaintext
Coins[] = [4, 15, 7, 3, 8, 9]
```

**Expected Output:**
```plaintext
Expected result: 27
DP Table:
(Display DP table as generated by the program)
Coins selected for optimal result: (Show chosen coins)
```

## Features
- Computes the **optimal game strategy** for the given set of coins.
- **Dynamic Programming Table** is displayed to show calculations.
- Identifies the **coins picked** by the winning strategy.
- User-friendly interface for better demonstration of results.
